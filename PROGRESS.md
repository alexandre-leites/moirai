# Implementation Progress

## Current Status

- Overall status: PR #75 review remediation complete; preparing push and CI verification.
- Current phase: production-readiness hardening.
- Active implementation: GitHub issues #64, #65, and #66.
- Last updated: 2026-07-28
- Agent/session identifier: agent/api-transport-observability

## In Progress

- [ ] Resolve PR #75 independent review findings
  - Started: 2026-07-28
  - Relevant files: `orchestrator/src/moirai`, `orchestrator/tests`, `runner/internal/control`
  - Current state: rebased onto `origin/main`; metrics use read-only control-plane state and runner mTLS integration coverage is passing.
  - Remaining work: push and CI monitoring.
  - Definition of done: metrics are backed by control-plane state and a runner↔orchestrator mTLS integration test passes.
  - Targeted validation: completed — 272 orchestrator tests, full API and runner race suites, ruff, and mypy.

## Done

- [x] Resolve core workflow correctness issues #37, #38, #39, #45, #46, #47, #58
  - Completed: 2026-07-28
  - Validation performed: 267 orchestrator tests, targeted Ruff, runner taskpacket/dispatch tests.

- [x] Structured logging, metrics, request correlation, and config-gated TLS
  - Completed: 2026-07-28
  - Behavior delivered: JSON logs retain extras, API propagates request IDs, and TLS/mTLS is config-gated across API, orchestrator, and runner.
  - Validation performed: API and runner Go tests/builds; 258 orchestrator tests; ruff, mypy, and Compose configuration.

## Blocked

- [ ] Fresh Compose boot and runner integration image build
  - Reason: Host/containerd disk exhaustion reported by the workflow-correctness workstream.
  - Independent work still available: PR #75 review remediation.

## Pending Implementation

- [ ] Continue next incomplete MVP requirement after PR #75.

## Quality Backlog

## Decisions

- Decision: Insecure gRPC remains the local-development default; TLS requires explicit configuration.
  - Context: remote runners require secure transport while existing Compose development remains compatible.
  - Reason: preserves compatibility and allows mTLS enforcement with a configured client CA.

- Decision: Metrics collection reads state only through the orchestrator control plane.
  - Context: database access belongs exclusively to the orchestrator.
  - Reason: preserves service boundaries while providing meaningful operational gauges.

## Validation Status

- Targeted tests: 272 orchestrator tests passed; runner mTLS integration test passed.
- Service tests: API `go test ./...` and runner `go test -race ./...` passed.
- Full repository tests: not run.
- Build: `go build ./cmd/api` and `go build ./cmd/runner` passed.
- Lint: ruff passed with EXE002 ignored.
- Type checks: mypy passed on all 47 orchestrator source files.
- Database migrations: not applicable.
- Docker Compose: configuration passed; fresh boot blocked by host disk exhaustion.
- End-to-end workflow: prior orchestrator fake-adapter suite passed.

## Known Issues

- Issue: Host disk exhaustion can block fresh Docker Compose verification.
  - Severity: Environment
  - Suggested resolution: Free Docker/build cache space before a fresh-container run.

## Next Recommended Implementation

Finish PR #75 review remediation, push it, and monitor CI until clean and mergeable.
