# Moirai Orchestrator

The orchestrator is the durable gRPC control plane. It applies database migrations, owns scheduling and workflow state, synchronizes GitHub issues, and receives runner events on port `50051`.

## Run locally

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -e '.[dev]'
LOOP_DATABASE_URL='postgresql://loop:password@localhost/loop' PYTHONPATH=src .venv/bin/python -m moirai.main
```

The startup path requires PostgreSQL and durable LangGraph checkpointing. `LOOP_ALLOW_NO_CHECKPOINTER=true` is only for reduced-capability tests and development environments.

## Workflow execution model

The issue workflow is an event-driven state machine, not a run-to-completion function. Every node that queues an agent execution (`plan`, `implement`, `pipeline`, `review`, `repair`, `push`) sets `awaiting_execution` and its outgoing edge ends the graph invocation. The gates the downstream nodes read (`plan_valid`, `pipeline_passed`, `review_approved`) only exist once that execution reports back, so continuing would route on stale defaults, queue phantom executions, and exhaust the retry budget before any agent ran.

The runner's terminal event clears `awaiting_execution` (`workflows/runner_events.py`), and `PersistedWorkflowRuntime.run` resumes the graph from the same edge with `aupdate_state` + `ainvoke(None, config)`. One terminal event therefore advances the workflow by at most one queued execution.

Resuming from that edge is a checkpointer capability. Without a checkpointer the only way forward is replaying the graph from its start node, which would re-enter nodes whose executions already ran, so a suspended run is left untouched and a warning is logged instead. Deployments that must make progress require a checkpointer; Compose never sets `LOOP_ALLOW_NO_CHECKPOINTER`.

## Operations

Logs are JSON and retain structured fields passed with Python logging `extra`. Metrics are served at `LOOP_METRICS_BIND` (default `0.0.0.0:9090`) on `/metrics`.

The gRPC listener stays insecure by default for local development. Set `LOOP_GRPC_TLS_CERT_FILE` and `LOOP_GRPC_TLS_KEY_FILE` to enable TLS. Set `LOOP_GRPC_TLS_CLIENT_CA_FILE` too to require runner mTLS certificates.

## Testing


## Configuration

| Variable | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `LOOP_DATABASE_URL` or `LOOP_DATABASE_URL_FILE` | required | PostgreSQL connection URL. Configure exactly one. |
| `LOOP_GRPC_BIND` | `0.0.0.0:50051` | gRPC bind host and port. |
| `LOOP_GITHUB_TOKEN` or `LOOP_GITHUB_TOKEN_FILE` | unset | Token passed to `gh` as `GH_TOKEN` for GitHub issue, pull request, and check operations. When set, startup verifies `gh auth status`. |
| `LOOP_INITIAL_ADMIN_USERNAME` | `admin` | Username created only when the user table is empty. |
| `LOOP_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD` or `LOOP_INITIAL_ADMIN_PASSWORD_FILE` | unset | Initial administrator password. Without it, bootstrap skips creating the user. |
| `RUNNER_REGISTRATION_TOKEN` | unset | Raw registration token seeded only during initial setup; it must match the runner's registration token. |
| `LOOP_SEED_PROJECT_NAME` | `demo` | Initial project name used only during bootstrap. |
| `LOOP_SEED_PROJECT_REPOSITORY_URL` | `https://github.com/example/demo.git` | Initial project repository URL. |
| `LOOP_SEED_TOKEN_LABELS` | `linux` | Comma-separated labels permitted by the seeded registration token. |
| `LOOP_SEED_ISSUE_TITLE` | unset | Optional initial issue title. |
| `LOOP_SEED_ISSUE_BODY` | unset | Initial issue body. |
| `LOOP_ALLOW_NO_CHECKPOINTER` | unset | Permit an unavailable checkpointer only when `true`, `yes`, or `1`. Workflows then cannot resume after dispatching an execution, so runs suspend permanently; tests and reduced-capability environments only. |

Secret values accept direct or `_FILE` forms, but not both. Secret files must be regular files no larger than 16 KiB.

Planner and reviewer result schemas are package resources in `src/moirai/workflows/schemas/`, so an image built with `orchestrator/` as its Docker context contains the schemas it validates.

## Validation

```bash
PYTHONPATH=src python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
python3 -m ruff check src tests
python3 -m mypy src
```
